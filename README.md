# Intrusion Detection System using KNN

This mini project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify network traffic as Normal or Intrusion.

## Algorithm
- KNN Classification
- Euclidean Distance
- Majority Voting

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle:

## Tools
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas

## Note
This project was developed as part of an academic mini project.
